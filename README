This is a tool for running LINQPad scripts from the command line. 

You can download it from: https://github.com/mcintyre321/LINQPadRunner/raw/master/LPRun.exe

usage:

    LPRun.exe somelinqpadfile.linq [args]


If you want to use command line options, you need to make the LINQPad script a program, 
and create a second Main method, with string arguments e.g. 

	void Main()
	{
		//this method will be run if you press f5 in LinqPad
		Main("arg0", "arg1");
	}

	void Main(params string[] args)
	{
		//this is used as the entry point by LPRun.exe so do stuff in here
	}
